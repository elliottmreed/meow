# Victory Condition and Win Screen Implementation

## Introduction  
This file outlines the implementation details for the victory condition and the corresponding win screen in the game.

## Victory Condition  
1. Define what constitutes a victory for the player.  
   - E.g., reaching a specific score, completing all levels, defeating a final boss, etc.  

2. Implement a check that evaluates whether the victory conditions have been met.  
   - This can be done using game state variables and logic checks connected to player actions.

3. Trigger the win screen when the victory conditions are met.  
   - Ensure that the game pauses and the current state is saved to avoid losing any progress.

## Win Screen  
1. Design the visual layout of the win screen.  
   - Ensure it contains relevant information such as the player's score, time taken, and any other achievements.

2. Include options for players:  
   - Replay the game  
   - Return to the main menu  
   - View leaderboard (if applicable)

3. Implement animations or effects that enhance the celebration of victory.  
   - E.g., confetti, sound effects, or character animations.

## Conclusion  
This file will be updated as we refine the implementation of the victory condition and win screen based on playtesting feedback.
